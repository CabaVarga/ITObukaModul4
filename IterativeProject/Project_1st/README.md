The first iteration consists of three phases, organized into three separate Tasks, with a number of subtasks.  

Every task will: (1) introduce a new model into the app, (2) followed by the associated controllers and (3) the defined endpoints.  

The first task is all about the **User**. We are creating an *UserModel* with the specified attributes, adding an associated *UserController* with a *GetDB()* method and the coding the endpoints from the specification.
