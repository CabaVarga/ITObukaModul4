Explanation:

Starting from Theme 2 (REST controllers) we are building a sample basic e-commerce application. After every new theme we need to expand the functionality and integrate the newly learned concepts into the app architecture.  
My intention is to create a separate project inside this solution for every iteration of the project. We had three iterations so far - I need to import the existing project files here and make the neccessary adjustments. I will start with iteration one, from Dan03.
